# lastpass-cli-attachments
A script to extract and save all the attachments in lastpass using the CLI tool.

Please note, this was inspired by the original get attachment script work by "mindrunner" on Github - many thanks
Thanks also to the contributors to the lpass-cli, this would be pointless without your efforts!

Tweaked to only check for entries with attachments and to deal with spaces in folders and files
Will try to improve the documentation and details another day... but hopwfully clear enough for now to be useful

You need to have lpass cli and zip/unzip installed as prerequisites to run
Login to Lastpass using the Cli, then run the script.
If the script doesn't work or you get something weird going on, run it with "-d" flag and it will print the details for each step.

Hopefully a little contribution to the internet that will help a few people and as a thankyou to everyone else who posts the various stuff that has helped or will help me.
